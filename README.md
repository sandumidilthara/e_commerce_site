In this project, there is an ecommerce site made using jsp. The name of the site is Easy Buy

Mobile phones,TV/Appliances,Furniture,Stationery.....etc categories products are sold on this ecommerce site.

n this project, both the admin side and the user side of the ecommerce site have been built

Both user and admin can come to the site and view the site

But if a user wants to buy products, he has to log in to the site by giving his email and password.

If he is not already registered on the site, he has to register and log in

After that, the user gets access to place orders

Admin has functions like product management, category management, user management and view order. Admin has to log in using email and password to access those functions

The admin is already registered on the site. The admin can log in to the site using the registered email and password.

Already as admin's email and password email = sandumidilthara729@gmail.com password = 44444 has been saved
If you refer this project and want to check the admin functions, log on to the site Sandumidilthara729@gmail.com as email and 44444 as password

When you log into the Site, if the email and password provided by the person logging in is the same as the email and password we have already registered as an administrator, the Site will recognize you as an administrator and navigate you to the Admin Dashboard and grant you access. To the functions of the administrator.

On this site, a user can filter the projects for sale into separate categories

Also, a user can purchase products, add the products to the cart, and place a user order and give a rating to the products after receiving the product. Those 3 features are still under build in this project. Very soon those three features will be complete.

Also, a user who logs into this site can see what offers are available on the relevant dates, contact sellers, get details about the site,  shipping policy details take care of frequently asked questions, and take care of careers and partners.

Also, the user and admin passwords of this project are encrypted

The database connection pooling concept has also been used in this project
